## About Tabeyo - Frontend

With the abundance of websites made to ease the search of recipes, not many accomodate to the fact that it's difficult to have every ingredient available at hand. Therefore, Tabeyo is focused on finding recipes with only what's available in the fridge/pantry.

Here's why:
* **No grocery store runs required:** Sometimes you don't have the time or resources to make a trip to the grocery store.
* **Resourceful cooking:** You often just want to use what you have as a resourceful adult.
* **Saving expired Ingredients:** You may have ingredients on the brink of expiration that want to use ASAP.

This is the frontend portion of Tabeyo, make sure to check out the [README of the backend](https://github.com/Lydia711/Tabeyo-backend) portion for the backend setup.
